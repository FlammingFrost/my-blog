Such a fancy dream. 

I planed and completed the idea within a 3-day holiday. But after such a "great achievement" for me, my enthusiasm for music started to fade away...

I had to acknowledge that learning to clip the video, and try to cooperate with myself in a song is so funny. This was the first time I start to realize a dream step by step. I mean, from the very basic idea I had, I miraculously built up skills or knowledge I might need. Without any roadmap, I just started to search for everything that might fit my object. It  sounds inefficient, but it simply works. After that, I began to believe that, the only requirement to acquire what I want is never the guidance of anyone, but the effort I pay and determination.

Though the work is imperfect, I really enjoy it. I have been busy with my study after that, with little time left for such exploration. But music does have power, and it brings me unforgettable memory. Me in video is bad-skilled and some kind of funny, and it can make me shamed every time my relatives mention it. 



But whatever, I never think of deleting it.
